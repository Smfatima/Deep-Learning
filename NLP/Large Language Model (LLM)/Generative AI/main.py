# Definition:  The models which are trained on text in unsupervised manner and with the help of tons of data, these foundational models named (LLMs)
"""
The advantages of LLMs models are:
1. Peformance - since they performed on terabytes of data, they outperform the small tasks
2. Productivity

There are some disadvantages of these models:
1. compute cost
2. Trust worthniess  
"""
"""Risk of LLMs models
Risks                   Strategies
1. Hallucinations         Explainability - you can give explaination when the models is answering falsehood
2. Bias                   Culture/Audits - need to 
when the model is 
focusing on one 
part/culture and their 
answers are related to it

3. Consent                Accountability

4. Security               Education
Hacking, and using
